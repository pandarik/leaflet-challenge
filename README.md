## USGS Earthquake Visualization - leaflet-challenge

# Background
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

# Project Overview
Objective: Build an interactive dashboard to visualize and analyze USGS earthquake data.
Data Source: USGS GeoJSON Feed
Features: Visualize earthquake data on a map. Display earthquake magnitude, location, and depth. Provide user-friendly interactivity.

# Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine. Install the necessary dependencies (e.g., Plotly). Make sure static/css, static/js folders, and logic.js are copied. Run the index.html code app to launch the dashboard.

# Dashboard Components
Map Visualization: Display earthquake data on a map using Leaflet.
Interactive Features: Allow users to filter data based on earthquake magnitude and depth. Click on each marker to get more details.

# Usage
Open the dashboard in your web browser.
Use the interactive features to explore earthquake data.
Learn about the distribution and impact of earthquakes globally.
